# sgrep - Semantic Grep

sgrep is a command-line tool that performs semantic searches on text input using word embeddings. It's designed to find semantically similar matches to the query, going beyond simple string matching. Supports multiple languages. The experience is designed to be similar to grep. 

## Example Usage

Search for words similar to "death" in Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea" with context and line numbers:

```bash
curl -s 'https://gutenberg.ca/ebooks/hemingwaye-oldmanandthesea/hemingwaye-oldmanandthesea-00-t.txt' \
    | sgrep -C 2 -n -threshold 0.55 death
```

Output:
![alt text](demo/image.png)

This command:

    - Fetches the text of "The Old Man and the Sea" from Project Gutenberg Canada
    - Pipes the text to sgrep
    - Searches for words semantically similar to "death"
    - Uses a similarity threshold of 0.55 (-threshold 0.55)
    - Displays 2 lines of context before and after each match (-C 2)
    - Shows line numbers (-n)

The output will show matches with their similarity scores, highlighted words, context, and line numbers.

## Features

- Semantic search using word embeddings 
- Configurable similarity threshold
- Context display (before and after matching lines)
- Color-coded output 
- Support for multiple languages 
- Read from files or stdin
- Configurable via JSON file and command-line arguments

## Installation

Two files are absolutely needed: 
1. the sgrep binary
2. the vector embedding model file
3. (Optionally, a config.json file to tell sgrep where the embedding model is)

**Using install script**:

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/arunsupe/semantic-grep.git
cd semantic-grep

# run install:
#   compiles using the local go compiler, installs in user/bin, 
#   downloads the model to $HOME/.config/semantic-grep
#   makes config.json
bash install.sh
``` 
**Binary**:

1. Download the latest binary release
2. Download a vector embedding model (see below)
3. Optionally, download the config.json to configure model location there (or do this from the command line)

**From source (linux/osx)**:

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/arunsupe/semantic-grep.git
cd semantic-grep

# build
go build -o sgrep

# download a word2vec model using this helper script (see "Word Embedding Model" below)
bash download-model.sh
```

## Usage

Basic usage:

./sgrep [options] <query> [file]

If no file is specified, sgrep reads from standard input.

### Command-line Options

- `-model_path`: Path to the Word2Vec model file ('models/glove/glove.6B.300d.bin'). Overrides config file.
- `-threshold`: Similarity threshold for matching (default: 0.7)
- `-A`: Number of lines to display after a match
- `-B`: Number of lines to display before a match
- `-C`: Number of lines to display before and after a match
- `-n`: Print line numbers
- `-o`: Print only matching word
- `-l`: Print only matched lines
- `-i`: Case insensitive matching

## Configuration

`sgrep` can be configured using a JSON file. By default, it looks for `config.json` in the current directory, "$HOME/.config/semantic-grep/config.json" and "/etc/semantic-grep/config.json".


## Word Embedding Model

### Quick start:
`sgrep` requires a word embedding model in __binary__ format. The default model loader uses the model file's extension to determine the type (.bin, .8bit.int). A few compatible model files are provided in this repo ([models/](models/)). Download one of the .bin files from the `models/` directory and update the path in config.json.

Note: `git clone` will not download the large binary model files unless git lfs is installed in your machine. If you do not want to install git-lfs, just manually download the model .bin file and place it in the correct folder.


### Support for multiple languages:
Facebook's fasttext group have published word vectors in [157 languages](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html) - an amazing resource. I want to host these files on my github account, but alas, they are too big and $$$. Therefore, I have provided a small go program, [fasttext-to-bin](model_processing_utils/), that can make `sgrep` compatible binary models from this. (note: use the text files with "__.vec.gz__" extension, not the binary ".bin.gz" files)

```bash
# e.g., for a French model:
curl -s 'https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-crawl/cc.fr.300.vec.gz' | gunzip -c | ./fasttext-to-bin -input - -output models/fasttext/cc.fr.300.bin

# use it like so:
# curl -s 'https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/17989/pg17989.txt' \
#    | sgrep -C 2 -n -threshold 0.55 \
#           -model_path model_processing_utils/cc.fr.300.bin 'ch√¢teau'
```

### Roll your own:
Alternatively, you can use pre-trained models (like Google's Word2Vec) or train your own using tools like gensim. Note though that there does not seem to be a standardized binary format (google's is different to facebook's fasttext or gensim's default _save()_). For `sgrep`, because efficiently loading the large model is key for performance, I have elected to keep the simplest format. 


## A word about performance of the different embedding models
Different models define "similarity" differently ([explaination](https://machinelearninginterview.com/topics/natural-language-processing/what-is-the-difference-between-word2vec-and-glove/)). However, for practical purposes, they seem equivalent enough.
